This site is generated with Next.js and exported as a static bundle for GitHub Pages.

- Build: `pnpm install && pnpm run build` (outputs to `out/` with `.nojekyll` and `index.html` at the root).
- Deploy: publish the `out/` folder as your Pages artifact or branch root; it already contains the required entry file.
